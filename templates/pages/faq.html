            <h3 class="info-section-title">When is the election?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                Election dates are announced via official school channels and listed on the <a href="{% url 'elections:list' %}" class="info-link">Elections</a> page.
            </p>

            <h3 class="info-section-title">Can I change my vote?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                No. Once your ballot is submitted, it is final and cannot be changed. Please review your choices carefully before submitting.
            </p>

            <h3 class="info-section-title">Is my vote anonymous?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                Yes. The system separates your identity from your ballot choices. We know <em>that</em> you voted, but not <em>who</em> you voted for.
            </p>

            <h3 class="info-section-title">What if I can't log in?</h3>
            <p class="info-text">
                If you are having trouble logging in, please contact the IT support desk or visit the Student Affairs office for assistance.
